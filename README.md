# 128-BIT-INTEGERS
A SET OF HEADERS USEFUL TO PERFORM INPUT AND OUTPUT OPERATIONS AND SOME USEFUL MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS FOR 128 BIT INTEGERS IN C/C++. FURTHER FUNCTIONALITIES MAY BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE AS NEEDED.


#OBSERVATION:

THE TOOM-COOK AND KARATSUBA MULTIPLICATION ALGORITHMS HERE PROVIDED MAY NOT YIELDSTHE CORRECT RESULT DEPENDING ON THE INPUT, DEPDENDING ON HOW THE COMPILER HANDLE 128 BIT INTEGERS. THESE ALGORITHM IN FACT ARE OF PRACTICAL USE ONLY FOR VALUES UP TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS DECIMAL DIGITS, WAY ABOVE THE VALUES THAT CAN BE STORED ON A 128 BIT INTEGER, THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE OVERHEAD TO HANDLE SUCH 'SMALL' INTEGERS. BUT THE IMPLEMENTATIONS HERE  PROVIDED ILLUSTRATE WELLTHE MAIN STEPS OF THE ALGORITHM.
